		<h2 class="pageheader">Hobbies and Interests</h2>
		
		<div class="pagemaincontent">
			<p>Some of my interests are literature, films, tv shows, and music. My hobies include blogging, redecorating spaces, and finding new inspirations. These things give me new ideas with their themes, tones, color schemes, and organizations.</p>
			<p>Some of my favourite books are:</br>
            Coast, a compilation of various authors, Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, and Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arther Conan Doyle.
            </p>
			
			<p>These films give me new ideas and design inspirations:</br>
            Anonymous, Byzantium, and Submarine.
            </p>
				
			<p>Television shows that I blog about are:</br>
            Supernatural, Doctor Who, Sherlock, The Game of Thrones, and Hannibal.
            </p>
			
			<p>My favourite bands and artists that inspire my edits and designs are:</br>
            Arctic Monkeys, Alex Turner, The xx, The 1975, Lorde, The Kills, and Alt-J
            </p>

            <p>This is one of the first GIFs that I've created to show my music interests.</p>

			<p>Another hobby that I enjoy is I love doing make up on myself and other people. I love to design and blend together colours that will highlight the focal point of the face and sculpting the structures to be prominent. Makeup is an artform. I am also very interested in nail art. It allows for creation of unique designs on mini canvases that we get to carry around with us.
			<p>As I mentioned before, I love drinking tea and coffee. They help me calm down, think, and organize my thoughts. Being in a coffee shop or a bakery somehow helps me to be more creative.</p>
