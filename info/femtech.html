            <!--This project will be started in your lab sections and you are expected to work on it in labs and as a homework assignment. You will prepare a write-up with images, webpage and or video links about one woman who works in a technology field. You will need to do some research on women in technology and/or could also do the project on someone you know or in your community. The questions you should answer include:

a) Who is this person? Why is her work in technology notable? 

b) What kind of technology-based work does she do? 

c) What company does she work for? What is the history of women in technology in that company? For this question, you will want to do some background research into the company and the company's statistics with regard to gender. 

d) Discuss if this person is or isn't well-known as a professional in her field, and consider why she is or isn't well-known in the public eye. You might also discuss here how hard or easy it was to find information about this person. 

Your project should be between 1000-1500 words and include supplementary information including images, videos, and hyperlinks that enhance our understanding of the subject of your research. -->
            
            <h3>PROFILE</h3>
            
            <p>Cindi Lema was born in Carson, CA. She attended <a href="https://carsonhs-lausd-ca.schoolloop.com/" class="obviouslinks" target="_blank">Carson High School</a> and got her Computer Science and Business Management Information Systems degrees at <a href="http://www.saintleo.edu/" class="obviouslinks" target="_blank">Saint Leo University</a> with Magna Cum Laude in the class of 2001</br>
            Before she started teaching, Lema was a website and graphic design business owner/consultant, a magazine editor for Goal Nevada, and a former online business magazine editor and programmer <a href="http://swcta.net/changcl/about/" class="obviouslinks" target="_blank">(Source)</a>. Now, she is the <a href="http://http://swcta.net/changcl/" target="_blank" class="obviouslinks">Web Design and Development Program Leader and  AP Computer Science teacher</a> at Southwest Career and Technology <a href="http://www.swcta.net" class="obviouslinks" target="_blank">(SWCTA)</a>, a local magnet school in Las Vegas, NV.</p>

            <h3>HER IMPACT AT SWCTA</h3>
<p>At SWCTA, students learn by Project Based Learning (PBL). Each year, Lema coordinates and runs events like <a href="http://swcta.net/changcl/2014/04/05/girls-in-tech-2014/" target="_blank" class="obviouslinks">Girls in Tech Conferences</a> and <a href="http://swcta.net/changcl/2014/10/15/hip-hop-meets-it/" target="_blank" class="obviouslinks">other SWCTA IT Conferences</a> to introduce coding to many students who never has experiences or opportunity to experimenting with coding before. Lema also hosts the <a href="http://www.code.org" class="obviouslinks" target="_blank">Hour of Code</a> with her web design students to spread interests of coding to students in other programs that may never typically interact with technologies such as culinary and respiratory programs. By doing this, her students did not only learn how to code, but also learn management skills to organize, communicate, and collaborate. Especially during the <a href="http://swcta.net/changcl/2014/04/05/girls-in-tech-2014/" target="_blank" class="obviouslinks">Girls in Tech Conferences</a>, females students were chosen to be section leaders. With that position, girls are able to prove themselves capable to manage large events. In another successful event,<a href="http://www.swcta.net/teachers/changcl/IT2015/" target="_blank" class="obviouslinks">2015 Hip Hop Meets IT Conference</a>, Lema and her web design students hosted a collaborative workshop that links the two unrelated groups together to exchange the cultures of the tech industry with the hiphop community. </p>
