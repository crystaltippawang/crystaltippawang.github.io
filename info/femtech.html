            <!--This project will be started in your lab sections and you are expected to work on it in labs and as a homework assignment. You will prepare a write-up with images, webpage and or video links about one woman who works in a technology field. You will need to do some research on women in technology and/or could also do the project on someone you know or in your community. The questions you should answer include:

a) Who is this person? Why is her work in technology notable? 

b) What kind of technology-based work does she do? 

c) What company does she work for? What is the history of women in technology in that company? For this question, you will want to do some background research into the company and the company's statistics with regard to gender. 

d) Discuss if this person is or isn't well-known as a professional in her field, and consider why she is or isn't well-known in the public eye. You might also discuss here how hard or easy it was to find information about this person. 

Your project should be between 1000-1500 words and include supplementary information including images, videos, and hyperlinks that enhance our understanding of the subject of your research. -->
            
            <h3>PROFILE</h3>
            
            <p>Cindi Lema was born in Carson, CA. She attended <a href="https://carsonhs-lausd-ca.schoolloop.com/" class="obviouslinks" target="_blank">Carson High School</a> and got her Computer Science and Business Management Information Systems degrees at <a href="http://www.saintleo.edu/" class="obviouslinks" target="_blank">Saint Leo University</a> with Magna Cum Laude in the class of 2001</br>
            Before she started teaching, Lema was a website and graphic design business owner/consultant, a magazine editor for Goal Nevada, and a former online business magazine editor and programmer <a href="http://swcta.net/changcl/about/" class="obviouslinks" target="_blank">(Source)</a>. Now, she is the <a href="http://http://swcta.net/changcl/" target="_blank" class="obviouslinks">Web Design and Development Program Leader and  AP Computer Science teacher</a> at Southwest Career and Technology <a href="http://www.swcta.net" class="obviouslinks" target="_blank">(SWCTA)</a>, a local magnet school in Las Vegas, NV.</p>

            <h3>HER IMPACT AT SWCTA</h3>
<p>At SWCTA, students learn by Project Based Learning (PBL). Each year, Lema coordinates and runs events like <a href="http://swcta.net/changcl/2014/04/05/girls-in-tech-2014/" target="_blank" class="obviouslinks">Girls in Tech Conferences</a> and <a href="http://swcta.net/changcl/2014/10/15/hip-hop-meets-it/" target="_blank" class="obviouslinks">other SWCTA IT Conferences</a> to introduce coding to many students who never has experiences or opportunity to experimenting with coding before. Lema also hosts the <a href="http://www.code.org" class="obviouslinks" target="_blank">Hour of Code</a> with her web design students to spread interests of coding to students in other programs that may never typically interact with technologies such as culinary and respiratory programs. By doing this, her students did not only learn how to code, but also learn management skills to organize, communicate, and collaborate. Especially during the <a href="http://swcta.net/changcl/2014/04/05/girls-in-tech-2014/" target="_blank" class="obviouslinks">Girls in Tech Conferences</a>, females students were chosen to be section leaders. With that position, girls are able to prove themselves capable to manage large events. In another successful event,<a href="http://www.swcta.net/teachers/changcl/IT2015/" target="_blank" class="obviouslinks">2015 Hip Hop Meets IT Conference</a>, Lema and her web design students hosted a collaborative workshop that links the two unrelated groups together to exchange the cultures of the tech industry with the hiphop community.</p>
    
            <h3>HER IMPACT ON STUDENTS</h3>
<p>Lema started Studio C to simulate real working environment in the web design and development program for each senior class to work in. There are two manager positions and five department leaders. By starting up Studio C, she provided students with the chance to go through interviews conducted by the former managers in the previous years. Students had to dress up professionally, prepare resumes and business cards, work on their online portfolio, and practice common interview questions with each other. When the managers and department leaders are chosen, the rest of the class apply to be in specific departments. There are marketing, content writing, coding, design, and usability teams. Needless to say the coding department seems to be the most technical part of the company. The coding department learns new programming languages and learned how to customize the site to the client’s needs. However, the other departments still benefit greatly by having to tailor their work to fit the site and the content delivers the message that clients on their sites. For example, Lema taught students to make websites responsive to make sure they work across all the screen sizes and to optimize graphics and photographs mobile and desktop display. Studio C has given students a year of experience in a company office environment to prepare them for technology companies.
Another big impact that she has on her students is the Senior Capstone Project. A senior student pairs up with another student to create a complete, functional site to answer the driving question. Students are expected to write up their own plans and timeline, do additional research, write up content, create original graphics, and code the whole site by the end of the school year. The project does not end there, each team gets to present their Capstone Projects to the people in the tech industry who critique their codes and presentation and also serve as mock venture capitalists to “invest” in the team that would “win start up funds.” Working on the Capstone Project made student learn coding and marketing on their own and every project has its potential to be a new tech start up. This year’s presentation also received press from Vegas StartUps. John Lynn, the writer of the article, was impressed by how the students made the site interactive and he also brought his children along to test out many projects. Here is the master link for the capstone from the class of 2015 and a video report about presentation.
    Lastly, two of the SWCTA web design alumni (Marcos Ontiveros and Blaze Brooks) have developed a mobile application that will be used county-wide in the future. It started off as a project in Lema’s class but when they presented it to their tech partner after they graduated, they turned Bully Alert into a startup business. Now, they are working with Clark County School District (CCSD) in “Work in Progress” in the Downtown Project of Las Vegas.</p>

<h3>CCSD HIRING STATISTICS</h3>
    <p>No information can be found about CCSD hiring statistics regarding the sexes of the teachers in the district. However, from experience, there are two female teachers in the information technology department. Maureen Clark is a graphic design and animation teacher and Cindi Lema is the program leader for web design and development. Terry Lively is a male video game design teacher and program leader. In the entertainment engineering department is led by Joshua Locklear, a male program leader.</p>

<h3>ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND REFLECTION ON LEMA</h3>
    <p>Cindi Lema was awarded Nevada State Career & Technical Education Teacher of the Year award in 2012 and received Educator Award recipient for the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) in 2014. Lema was also involved in the executive board in the Nevada ACTE, the advocate for career and technology education. She is considered to be well known in the school district, but not well known to the public. It is not surprising, since she is a high school teacher who makes her impact in the district and the Las Vegas community. As mentioned before, she continues to work hard to coordinate and host events in SWCTA to attract and spark interests in the tech industry. Her impact extends to all the students that have attended her class and continue to pursue their career paths in the tech industry.</p>
