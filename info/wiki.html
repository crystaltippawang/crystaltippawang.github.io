            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>

                <p>In today's lab of learning to edit and contribute to Wikipedia, I have changed my mind on a lot of things about it. To answer the main question, I am not surprised at all at how easy it was to edit the articles on the site. I've always known that it was supposed to be open to everyone and it is not the most reliable source of academic research and information. However, the lab have changed my mind on the contribution to the Wiki. I didn't know that Wikipedia has such a strong community base and the people who "works" or volunteer a huge amount of their time to monitor and administrate the changes to the site. I had no idea that the articles are so closely watched by other editors and bots.</p>
            
                <p>Some of the strengths about the design of this test are that it relies on the quick, automatic response and that it switches the hands around so it doesn't measure the practiced results. However, I feel like that adds to the weakness of the test. I think it was not helpful that they conditioned the test taker to the stereotypical to one hand and then switched them around to the other hand when we are actually taking the ones that "breaks the stereotype". I think this test is pretty useful for bringing up awareness of the inequity in society. However, it should have more follow through information. Because if someone just took this test and found out that he or she has a strong bias, then it would be difficult for he or she to change how they think or act.</p>
