            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>

                <p>In today's lab of learning to edit and contribute to Wikipedia, I have changed my mind on a lot of things about it. To answer the main question, I am not surprised at all at how easy it was to edit the articles on the site. I've always known that it was supposed to be open to everyone and it is not the most reliable source of academic research and information. However, the lab have changed my mind on the contribution to the Wiki. I didn't know that Wikipedia has such a strong community base and the people who "works" or volunteer a huge amount of their time to monitor and administrate the changes to the site. I had no idea that the articles are so closely watched by other editors and bots.</p>
            
                <p>Another thing that I was surprised to learn is the technicality of the site. I did not know that it has its own sort of coding language and that the user has to have a certain technology literacy to really contribute to it. Since it is so closely watched by more "technical" users and editors, now I think that site might actually has more validity as I originally thought that it would be. I still would not site Wikipedia in my research paper, but I feel like I can get the basic information from it to further my research from more valid sources since the information are verified by so many editors.</p>
            
                <p>As I am now finishing up my reflection after the lecture, I feel like I need to add more about the presentation and discussions today. To answer the other main question, I am partially concerned and not concerned to how easy it is to edit a Wikipedia page. I am not concerned that it was easy becaused even though anyone can edit it, there are always other editors who watch over the information that is being contributed to varify these changes. However, I am concerned about the moderators and who get the ultimate power on making the changes to the articles. In the lecture, I learned that most of the top editors or contributors are the ones who have the dominant power in the society. It is concerning that they have the potential power to take away the point of view or information that the others are publishing on the site. Also, they could "silence" the non-majority editors and delete the pages and revert the information that they get to decide to be "unimportant" or "trivial".</p>
