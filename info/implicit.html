            <p>Your data suggest a moderate association of Male with Career and Female with Family compared to Female with Career and Male with family.</p>

            <h3>WHAT DID THE TEST TELL YOU ABOUT YOURSELF AND WERE YOU SURPRISED? HOW DO YOU THINK THIS TEST WORKS? WHAT ARE THE STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF ITS DESIGN? HOW USEFUL DO YOU THINK TIS TEST IS FOR CHANGING SOCIAL INEQUALITY? EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER.</h3>
                
                <p>The test tells me that I still have an implicit bias towards each gender. I am not surprised at the result because it is how I am conditioned to be no matter how much and how hard I try to actively unlearn this bias. I believe that it is a condition that I have learned and picked up as child and it will still linger on, even if it's a subconcious thought or association.</p>
