            <h2>TEST RESULT</h2>
            
            <p>Your data suggest a moderate association of Male with Career and Female with Family compared to Female with Career and Male with family.</p>
                
            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
                
            <h3>WHAT DID THE TEST TELL YOU ABOUT YOURSELF AND WERE YOU SURPRISED? HOW DO YOU THINK THIS TEST WORKS? WHAT ARE THE STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF ITS DESIGN? HOW USEFUL DO YOU THINK THIS TEST IS FOR CHANGING SOCIAL INEQUALITY? EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER.</h3>
                
                <p>The test tells me that I still have an implicit bias towards each gender. I am not surprised at the result at all because I knew that even though conciously, I don't really associate each gender with family or career, but it would be there in the subconcious and automatic thoughts. I believe that it is a condition that I have learned and picked up as child and it will still linger on and I will still have to keep unlearning these associations. I think that this test is supposed to follow the automatic stereotypical association with the genders and then switch them up to test the taker's automatic responses to see what we would associate each gender with.</p>
            
                <p>Some of the strengths about the design of this test are that it relies on your quick, automatic response and that it switches the hands around so it doesn't measure the practiced results. However, I feel like that adds to the weakness of the test. I think it was not helpful that they conditioned the test taker to the stereotypical to one hand and then switched them around to the other hand when we are actually taking the ones that "breaks the stereotype". I think this test is pretty useful for bringing up awareness of the inequity in society. However, it should have more follow through information. Because if someone just took this test and found out that he or she has strong bias, then it would difficult for he or she to change how they think or act.</p>
