			<h3>Freshman Year</h3>
			
			<h2>Content Knowledge</h2>
			
			<p>Description: When I got into Graphic Design I class in freshman year, we learned how to use Adobe Illustrator. When we wrapped up the lessons on some basic skills, we put the skills that we learned to make the box person. The box person is supposed to get folded together perfectly. When it was done, we printed them out, cut and glue them together, and then we displayed them on the show case.</p>
			<p>You can view the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-IF9WfxjpSUNGlmMHVuTEVGeVE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p>
			<p>Reflection: Looking back at that project, I surprisingly loved it. It turned out really well and my box person folded into the box perfectly. It was a project that I really enjoyed doing in freshman year.</p>
			
			<h2>Writing Skills</h2>
			
			<p>In English I H, we read the book Into the Wild by Jack Krakauer. After that, we had to write the argument on weather Christopher McCandless was reckless or not.</p>
			<p>You can view the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-IF9WfxjpSUODlVRjVEUE93RE0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p>
			<p>Reflection: I'm surprised that I got such a good grade on it. After going back to think about the essay, it was an easy argument and I see that I have improved my writing skills so much.</p>
			
			<h2>Presentation</h2>
			
			<p>Description: The first assignment in the Graphic Design I class was to introduce myself in front of the whole class. That was when we were introduced to using Prezi. In that presentation, I just had to talk about myself (hobbies and favourites) and skills.</p>
			<p>You can view the project <a href="http://prezi.com/vndfa4kv7b_i/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share">here</a></p>
			<p>Reflection: That was probably the easiest presentation that I have ever done. I remembered that I was so nervous to go in front of everyone. Now, I don't even really think about it anymore. I know that I'm used to speaking in front of a crowd.</p>
			
			<h2>Teamwork</h2>
			
			<p>Description: This project went hand in hand with the the content Use of Resources. Since we were learning about the Holocaust, we had to do a presentation on a subtopic of the Holocaust. I paired up with a classmate to present about the Medical Experiments during that time. We always kept in contact with each other during the building of that presentation.</p>
			<p>You can view the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-IF9WfxjpSUZmRKbU5ud3l4dVE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p>
			<p>Reflection: By the time we had to do this project, it was the end of the year. So my presentation skills had improved. The teamwork skills that I had learned by the end of the year was so much better. I learned to make sure that everything will go well during and at the wrap up of the presentation.</p>
			
			<h2>Work Ethic</h2>
			
			<p>Description: SWCTA really focused on turning things in on time since we entered the school. During each week, we get sketchbook assignments to improve our skills. I turned everything in on time.</p>
			<p>You can view the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-IF9WfxjpSUeWE0Szh3UV8zNTQ/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p>
			<p>Reflection: This assignment really helped me to make sure that I keep my schedule organized to finish each assignments on time.</p>
			
			<h2>Use of Resources</h2>
			
			<p>Description: This was the first research paper that we had to do that was graded on every details of bibliography and citing everything correctly. This was done at the end of the freshman year, in spring.</p>
			<p>You can view the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-IF9WfxjpSULVNsellpWkNuaW8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p>
			<p>Reflection: My partner and I got a really good grade on it. It helped me to get things correct the first time and to keep my notes organized.</p>

			<h3>Junior Year</h3>
			
            <h2>Content Knowledge: Timed Writing and APUSH Newspaper Article</h2>
            
            <p>Timed Writing Description: Through out the year in AP English Language and Composition class, we have to practice responding to a prompt in 40 minutes for the AP exam in May.</p>
            
            <p>You can view the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-IF9WfxjpSUUXIxSmVYYjBfR1k/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            
            <p>Reflection: I wrote this essay at the end of the year. Even though it was one of the most stressful classes that I've ever taken, it really improve my writing. It taught me how to prove my point and argue clearly in writing.</p>
            
            <p>APUSH News Paper Description: We were to pick a significant event during the colonial time in America before the revolution and describe how it impacted the colonists. So I chose the Proclamation of 1673, because it angered many English, leading them in further conflicts with the Parliament.</p>
            
            <p>You can view the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-IF9WfxjpSUelE1b1lsX1pLeU0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            
            <p>Reflection: Even though this project did require a lot of researches, I decided to put this in the Content Knowledge section because I already learned about main concept of it.</p>
            
            <h2>Writing Skills: APUSH DBQ and Music Monday</h2>
            
            <p>APUSH DBQ Description: Like AP English Language and Composition, AP US History also required timed writing, but in Document Based Question. We had to use our previous knowledge to analyze each documents to use them to back up our argument or point in the promt.</p>
            
            <p>You can view the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-IF9WfxjpSUUllrNWNScUp3WmM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            
            <p>Reflection: I enjoyed this topic because I am personally interested in the topic. It was easy for me to form an argument and I am extremely proud of the out come.</p>
            
            <p>Music Monday Description: At the end of the year, we focused on analysis of different texts. One of the assignments was to analyze a song from different eras.</p>
            
            <p>You can view the project <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o9HvPsbfG0OkVX-aF8KSzCHctTm5k4oPMwIiZkkqAR8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            
            <p>Reflection: Of course I chose my favourite song from the 90s by Bikini Kills. Again, I already knew a lot about the subject, so I did quite enjoy writing about the Riot Grrl movement.</p>
            
            <h2>Presentation: Fun Camp, Inc. and ACA Graphic Contest</h2>
            
            <p>Fun Camp, Inc. Description: We had to work with Wordpress for the first time and this was also the first project for our class to present in front of actual clients.</p>
            
            <p>You can view the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-IF9WfxjpSUcmgwZjd3MUN0WGM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            
            <p>Reflection: Admittedly, our team had a lot of trouble to figure out how to work with PHP. However, we figured things out line by line of codes. It was a great news to us when the clients were really appreciative of our concept.</p>
            
            <p> ACA Graphic Contest Description: As the final project for Media For Web Class, each of the students had to make a graphic for a contest. I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to create something inspiring to keep me working hard in senior year.</p>
            
            <p>You can view the graphic <a href="images/aca.jpg" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            
            <p>Reflection: After a year's weekly practice, graphic designs come easier for me to do. I've always been more comfortable with work on paper. But since I've messed around with Photoshop on weekly basis, I discovered the wonderful liquidising tool, which is perfect in my art style. I love how this graphic turned out.</p>
            
            <h2>Teamwork: Build-A-Creature Workshop and Ben Nelson's Site</h2>
            
            <p>Build-A-Creature Workshop Description: During 2014 Girls In Tech Conference, I was a group leader to make sure we were prepared for the conference. I also worked with the other leaders to coordinate our presentation time so that the students won't be late to their next workshop. We chose to be the team to make different assets so that middle school students can put them together into the graphic version of what they made with the fashion students.</p>
            
            <p>You can view the project <a href="images/showcase_graphic.png" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            
            <p>Reflection: During the conference, I had to always watch the clock and make sure that my team knows what was going on. Organization and communication were the key to run this presenation with the class of 2016.</p>
            
            <p>Ben Nelson's Website Description: This was a huge project. We divided the class in half to code and the other half to animate the Autism Awareness Animation. I was in the web team. At first, I was in the design department, but when the coding team needed help, I was the one to coordinate the site to come together.</p>
            
            <p>You can view the site <a href="http://www.cartoonben.com" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            
            <p>Reflection: It was extremely difficult to work with so much people in a project, but it did give me a real experience in working on a live site. I ended up being the head coder of the site, so I was one of the presenters at the screening at Foothill High School.</p>
            
            <h2>Work Ethic: Modes Project and APUSH Summer Notes</h2>
            
            <p>Modes Project Description: In AP English Language and Composition class, we learned about writing in different writing modes, hence the project name: Mode Project. The challenge of this project was that we had a lot of time to write different modes out, and it's up to us to keep up with the deadlines.</p>
            
            <p>You can view the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-IF9WfxjpSUeTRnQk5DZloxdlU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            
            <p>Reflection: This project was extremely stressful to finish everything on time. But because I always follow each date guideline, I had everything finished in time when the final project was due.</p>
            
            <p>APUSH Summer Notes Description: During summer of 2013, before we enter APUSH class in fall, we had to start taking notes ahead so that we can meet the deadline of the AP exam in May. There was no date guideline whatsoever, so the end product was really up to the students.</p>
            
            <p>You can view the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-IF9WfxjpSURDQ4Qm4zUUtaaG8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            
            <p>Reflection: Eventhough I had to give up going out for some parts of summer, I was glad to be finished with it. I didn't have to stay up the night before to get everythign finished.</p>
            
            <h2>Use of Resources: MUN and Synthesis Project</h2>
            
            <p>MUN Description: I participated in Model United States at Spring Valley High School this year (2014). I had to do researches about the economy and social problems and then form a position on it, so that I can make correct choices during the conference.</p>
            
            <p>You can view the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-IF9WfxjpSUX2tQeW8yTkZwMnc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            
            <p>Reflection: Without the researches, I would've never known about all these organizations that aim to help the Middle East, but Irag (my country position) is still behind. Since they have to face the Talibans opposition, so their development is slower than other neighboring countries. I had to use the correct key words and terms to find the information needed.</p>
            
            <p>Synthesis Project Description: Another prompt in AP English Language and Composition is to synthesize documents to form an argument. So the synthesis project helped us to identify useful informations that we can use in our positions without bias.</p>
            
            <p>You can view the project <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/swcta.net/document/d/1F01uo08f_UPWpyw1AXu3oI_-_vdFwKEm6LvtNlPa_Mk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            
            <p>Reflection: Surprisingly, there was not a lot of document on our topic(budget cut on music in school). There were only sources to oppose it. So I had to find the counterargument about supporting more math and science.</p>
